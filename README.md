# Statement-of-Purpose

Glad you stumble upon my repositories. I hope you find my content interesting and helpful.

## Who am I?

I am a Ph.D. candidate (soon graduate) in [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) at a top research university in North America.

## What is this account for?

I use this account to post controversial opinions anonymously.

## Why (Github)?

Twitter is too noisy and generally not great for presenting serious information. Plus, I am too lazy to write actual blog posts. However, this account may evolve to become a blog in the future.

## Why should I care?

The number one rule I will try to stick to when posting with this account is that I will refrain from posting something that is just a rant. I will only post something if it is unique from me (mostly by luck or privilege) and thus not easily accessible by the general audience. View it as an attempt to democratize valuable information or conduct a special kind of journalism if you would like.

All my content will be extremely punchy and to-the-point: I am a STEM person. I do not like beating around the bush. So even if you are a busy person, most of my posts will be a quick read (in a format quite like this document).

## Why hide yourself?

The other part of my content rule is that I will not bother using this account to post information if it is not controversial and impactful at the same time. I expect a lot of my content here to rub many people the wrong way to the point of seeking real-world retribution on me. In short, I do not want my life (and generally I have a very good life ahead of me) destroyed because of my opinion.

## On "sources"

Do not ask me for sources. If I consistently annotate my sources, it will be an extremely tedious task because the sources are either 1) from myself 2) something you can easily look up with a 5-min Google/Wikipedia search. If you find any exception, let me know in the issues.

## On "rigor"

Do not expect my content to be rigorous, inclusive, or comprehensive. The only standard I hold myself to here is ensure every statement is made on a _prima facie_ basis (i.e., "sufficient to establish a fact or a case unless disproved"[[1]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prima%20facie)). Ultimately, my content is meant to offer a perspective that is authentic from faithfully observed life experiences, as opposed to establish an academic set of true knowledge. If you find any exception, let me know in the issues.
